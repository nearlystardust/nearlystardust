## 👋🏻 Hi! I'm [Mia](https://miaschultz.net)!

I'm a student who's currently learning programming on my own (though I plan on going to college next fall), along with working on other technology-related stuff in my spare time. 

I'm not working on any one thing in particular -- if you see me doing anything and you'd like to help, I wouldn't mind at all! Feel free to contact me at any time, either through the email on my GitHub profile or through [my Discord server](https://discord.gg//HEQzxf3z2V).
